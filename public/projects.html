  <h3>CSV Bill of Material Comparison Executable</h3>
  <p><em>Developed as Personal Project for WestRock Company</em>, July 2023
    <ul>
      <li>Languages Used: Python</li>
      <li>Libraries Used: pandas, Tkinter</li>
      <li>Purpose: Within the engineering world, it is often that CAD Bill of Material (BOM) outputs do not correlate with ERP BOM data, meaning that the manufacturing floor does not have accurate parts when compared to engineering drawings/specifications. This program is meant to take two BOMs in CSV form, compare them, and return any differences, including both similar parts having different quantities as well as parts that exist in one and not the other</li>
      <li>Outcomes:
      <ul>
        <li>Successfully developed and presented an independent executable for plant-wide use</li>
        <li>Decreased comparison error by 11%</li>
        <li>Decreased time necessary for comparison by 75%</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
