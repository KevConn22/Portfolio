    <p><em>Mechanical Engineering Intern</em>, May 2023 - Aug. 2023
        <ul>
            <li>Redesigned and optimized a databaase consisting of 2,000+ parts, implementing changes to include additional dimensioning information,
            increase searchability, and refine part categorization to decrease design downtime</li>
            <li>Updated and verified 20 CAD subassemblies/drawings and their BOMs to correlate with internal manufacturing
            ERP data, decreasing engineering workload and production time on new machines</li>
            <li>Configured 40+ subaseemblies and their drawings in Inventor to match updated dimensioning information, 
            creating 13 unique tooling groups for customer's use across 6 purchased machines</li>
            <li>Programmed a Python executable to compare EBOM and MBOM CSVs, streamlining the comparison process by
                decreasing comparison error by an average of 11% and decreasing comparison time by an average of 75%</li>
        </ul>
