    <h3>About Me</h3>

    <p>"Veni, vidi, vici. I came, I saw, I conquered."</p>
    <p>Those words, spoken since humankind's conception, represent the true human spirit.  We are meant to explore, pushing the boundaries of the physical world, creating new, innovative solutions to better discover our place in this vast universe that we call home.</p>
    <p>In my career, I hope to do just that: find solutions to push the boundaries of the human condition, creating better, safer, and more expansive lives for the world at large.  With wide-reaching knowledge in a variety of engineering/CS disciplines, I hope to parlay my knowledge into the innovation of human-centered technology, powering us to a future that allows us to touch the dreams we all once had; dreams to live among the stars.</p>
